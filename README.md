# Webpack template

Simple template with the Webpack tool for the integration of web applications.

This integrates the Sass pre-processor, PostCSS in order to autoprefix the CSS
properties as well as the Webpack dev server in order to benefit from a server
rebuilding the assets and automatically reloading the page with each modification.

## Usage

To use the Webpack tool, you will simply need to download the dependencies with
**NPM** or **Yarn**.

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
Then you have the choice between two commands allowing you to build the assets:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

Or start the development server (it will automatically open in your default
browser):

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
